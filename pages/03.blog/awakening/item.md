Ahhh, to wake up in a new place with new sounds and new air -- refreshing!

We got up a little before dawn here in the beautiful mountain town of Guanajuato in Mexico this morning.  The area around our hostel, Hostel Alonzo, in the heart of the Zona Central is starting to bustle already.  As the flock of pigeons started to stir and walk around their innumerable little cubbies and niches in the wall across the street, the roosters started crowing in the day from houses all around us, and all the wild birdies started to sing in the morning, I sipped my hot coffee on the rooftop terrace that Glenn hiked down and bought for us earlier.

What will this day hold in store for us?
