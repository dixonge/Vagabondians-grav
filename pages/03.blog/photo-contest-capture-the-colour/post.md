These are some photos I entered into a contest. It was totally rigged! How do I know? Because my buddy Wes Nations (Johnny Vagabond) won. That's how!

:/

Here are my entries...

    Sapphire Pool -- Yellowstone National Park





The Sapphire Pool at Yellowstone National Park. It doesn't get any bluer than that, does it?




  <strong>GREEN</strong>

    Humboldt Redwoods State Park, California





This is from Humboldt Redwoods State Park in northern California. In the background you can see the roots of one of many fallen Coastal Redwoods. It was never a record-holder, but it probably lived several hundred years before it fell. Most people probably don't take this shot, but something about the surrounding greenery and lighting caught my attention.




  <strong>YELLOW</strong>

    Sunset -- West Yellowstone, Montana





After a long day on the south side of Yellowstone National Park taking photos of geysers Bryn shot this wonderfully diffuse sunset through the windshield. It came out much better than I ever would have thought possible.


  <strong>WHITE</strong>

    Geyser -- Yellowstone National Park




  White-hot steamy water, shooting from deep below the surface, straining to reach the heights, piercing the blue sky. Yellowstone National Park
