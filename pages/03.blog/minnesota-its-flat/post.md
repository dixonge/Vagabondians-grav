We first met our wine-making friends Del and Kat Erickson in 2007 when Kat and her daughter Jessica came to Texas for Winestock. Since we were fairly nearby we veered a bit north and dropped in for a visit. We got to see their house, her husband Del's farm, daughter Jessica's family in Grand Forks, ND and much more. Enjoy the slideshow, read the captions!
