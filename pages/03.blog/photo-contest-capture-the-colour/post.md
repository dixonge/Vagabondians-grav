These are some photos I entered into a contest. It was totally rigged! How do I know? Because my buddy Wes Nations (Johnny Vagabond) won. That's how!

:/

Here are my entries...

**BLUE**

The Sapphire Pool at Yellowstone National Park. It doesn't get any bluer than that, does it?

**GREEN**

This is from Humboldt Redwoods State Park in northern California. In the background you can see the roots of one of many fallen Coastal Redwoods. It was never a record-holder, but it probably lived several hundred years before it fell. Most people probably don't take this shot, but something about the surrounding greenery and lighting caught my attention.

**YELLOW**

After a long day on the south side of Yellowstone National Park taking photos of geysers Bryn shot this wonderfully diffuse sunset through the windshield. It came out much better than I ever would have thought possible.

**WHITE**

  White-hot steamy water, shooting from deep below the surface, straining to reach the heights, piercing the blue sky. Yellowstone National Park

**RED**

  One of the few balloons which flew directly over our position. Plano Balloon Festival.
